# simplekeylogger
use this program for learning purposes only. I accept no responsibility for any outlaw use of my program.

For use this python keylogger :

1) create the directories to save files, and change their names in the bat and python program
2) put your tree structure on a usb key from where the program will be executed 
3) execute the .bat file for download "keyboard library", copy all document of the user in your usb-key and run the python script.
4) let's the program run as long as you want the program to record the keys. when you have finished recording, press "escape".

all the key are recorded and save in the .txt file.

I have deliberately omitted the destination files so that you can try to understand the code.

good luck ;)
